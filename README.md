# Wine-Quality-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
we use wine dataset. Our goal is to train a random forest classifier to predict the quality of wine samples based on their physicochemical properties. We will begin by preprocessing the dataset, splitting it into training and testing sets, and then building and training a random forest classifier.
